The dataset is about Olympics data from Year 1896 to 2012. The dataset was formed by combining two datasets :

Summer.csv : This has all the details about the olympics including country code, hosting city, athlete name, sporting events and the medals won.

ISO_Codes.csv: This has the ISO codes for all the countries in the world 

The Dataset formed by combining these three datasets is called OLYMPICS Dataset. It gives details about the hosting city, Countries participating in Olympics, the sports that were there in the Olympics for every Olympic year, the disciplines in every sport, Name of Athletes participating in the events, name of the vent for every discipline of every sports and the medals won by each athlete, the population of Country participating, the per Capita GDP for that country and the respective ISO code.

The plots can be seen by hovering on a country for which, you want to see the medal count. The world map displayed is a choropleth world map displayed. The choropleth maps present are based on Population and GDP percapita income.
